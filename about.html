				<h2>What Started this?</h2>
		</header>
        
			<p>Black Gekko Development started with a simple idea, we decided we were going to make a game review site, a project for us to have on our own. This project stared with us diving knee deep 			into learing how to code and create websites. After much time spent learning all the HTML and CSS elements, we began on the site. After about a month of coding and watching this amazing site 			come together we thought the same question, why would'nt we make this a thing. We took our knowlege and whilst still building upon it, began to plan a way to create websites that would really 			inculde what people want, their content. Thus Black Gekko Development began, upon a dream and a want to give people what they really want in a website.</p>

				<h2>Of course we do!</h2>
		</header>
		
			<p>Our mission is simple, we want people or buisnesses to be able to have websites created witht he content they want, and with the funcionality they need. There are many "free" sites out 			there that will create your site for you, but these sites do not always have all the functionality that you need. In the other hand other organizations may try and rob you for a simple 				website, but here at Black Gekko, we give you what you want, for prices that are hard to beat.</p>
