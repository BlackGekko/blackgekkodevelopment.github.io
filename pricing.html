		<div class="contentPricing">
			<p>Black Gekko does not have exact rates becuase not every website is the same. We base the price on what you want for your site, a site with a single page would be much less than a website 			with five pages and a built in user portal. But dont let this discourage you, the average website with a home, about, and contact page, with a few little goodies would cost around $300 				initaly, with a lower price per month/year.</p>

			<h1>When do I get charged?</h1>
			<h2>Payments</h2>

		<div class="payments">
			<p>We understand a new organization can seem untrustworthy, with this, we will alow our customers to make payments per month/week. This will allow the customer to not have to commit the full 			price in fear of things not getting done. These monthly/weekly prices will be discused during the planing phase of the website, this is also the time quoting will occur.</p>
